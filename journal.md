I'd say my experience learning python hasn't been so bad. It's true that it's kinda like learning another language but at least the words are still in a language that I know. 
I've been a bit slow on my journey since my school changed my account for whatever reason but it's fine because I'm back on track. Writing notes makes the process slower but it helps
me learn better so oh well. I can't wait to learn other coding languages and basically just learn how to code better in general, I'm over coding these drones.
