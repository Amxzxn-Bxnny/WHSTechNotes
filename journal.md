# September 4, 2024, and September 5, 2024,
Python for me is kinda hard but only because I'm used to coding with blocks and unfortunately for me in my Fundamentals of Computer Science Class the kids weren't very smart and constantly dragged me down. Also my teacher didn't explain things well. Anyway, Python isn't too bad but I need to be more resourceful when it comes to my time because I'm a bit behind. Today, I'm definitly going to be faster and more vigilant with my time to take the necessary amount to take notes and actions in my Python coding journey.

I'd say my experience learning python hasn't been so bad. It's true that it's kinda like learning another language but at least the words are still in a language that I know. 
I've been a bit slow on my journey since my school changed my account for whatever reason but it's fine because I'm back on track. Writing notes makes the process slower but it helps
me learn better so oh well. I can't wait to learn other coding languages and basically just learn how to code better in general, I'm over coding these drones.

Easy and simple, honestly I got it first try and I'm not sure how others didn't. Though I don't mean to be condescending, everyone moves at their own pace I guess. It was easier for me to just read the instructions on the Github stuff that you gave me the link to.
