Python for me is kinda hard but only because I'm used to coding with blocks and unfortunately for me in my Fundamentals of Computer Science Class the kids weren't very smart and constantly dragged me down. Also my teacher didn't explain things well. Anyway, Python isn't too bad but I need to be more resourceful when it comes to my time because I'm a bit behind. Today, I'm definitly going to be faster and more vigilant with my time to take the necessary amount to take notes and actions in my Python coding journey.

I'd say my experience learning python hasn't been so bad. It's true that it's kinda like learning another language but at least the words are still in a language that I know. I've been a bit slow on my journey since my school changed my account for whatever reason but it's fine because I'm back on track. Writing notes makes the process slower but it helps me learn better so oh well. I can't wait to learn other coding languages and basically just learn how to code better in general, I'm over coding these drones.

Easy and simple, honestly I got it first try and I'm not sure how others didn't. Though I don't mean to be condescending, everyone moves at their own pace I guess. It was easier for me to just read the instructions on the Github stuff that you gave me the link to.

Following instructions exactly as they're told in coding are important because it'll get you where you need to be with little to no problems. If you keep your code nice and precise your code should come out like how you planned it to come out. If you miss a step or make a mistake with coding you may get an error and your code will malfunction or just simply not work. If you maintian good habits of paying attention to detail it'll be beneficial to you by allowing you to notice mistakes or instructions others might've missed.

Things like phones, tvs, and even a washing machine were created thanks to computer science. I use my phone everyday to contact my friends and family, my tv for entertainment purposes, and my washing machine quickly and efficiently cleans my clothes. Without computer science, I would lose tabs on my friends, probably play outside in the dirt and mud like a medieval child, and wash my clothes by hand. That would be hell on Earth. Not only that but I'd probably have to ride a bike or walk to school since modern day cars with gps and sterio and whatnot were also made by the hands of computer science.

For this assignment I researched a video game developer. Video game developers mostly just design/make video games for consoles, computers, and mobile. The skills required to be a video game developer are storytelling ability, creativity, game mechanics, programming skills, and etc. Education required is a bachelor's at minimum. By being a game developer you should expect to grow more creatively and become better at coding. I'm not intersted in being a video game developer myself but it does seem fun.

Even if you don't have a job that includes the need to code, coding is still an important thing to know. Coding is capable of giving you subperb problem solving skill by making you break down the steps to complex problems and simpifying it into something easier to understand. If you're in a field like education, finance, and healthcare then knowing how to code might help you with things like problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Knowing code can also help enhance creativity and collaboration by allowing you to think outside the box and giving to the courage and humility to ask for help and work with others.

AI is becoming a more prominent and controversial topic in today's society so I'm here to give the benefits and risks of AI. One benefit of AI is it reduces human errors by doing things with more efficiency and with more accuracy. AI saves time and can aid us people digitally by giving us answers to questions we may have. It makes unbiased decisions which can really be helpful when certain people can't seperate facts and opinions.
AI can be helpful but it also poses risks as well. Although it can't take over the world, it can promote human laziness by causing humans to heavily rely on it over time. AI can also replace humans for jobs that AI can perform "better" and more efficiently. AI also lacks emotional intelligence so there's that too. No sure why, but humans become paranoid over things that don't have feelings too which is why it's seen as a drawback.

The election is an important event that happens once every four years. As of modern times, technology has played an important role in the election like social media and voting machines. One positive impact of technology being used for the election is the creation of voting machines which makes voting faster, more efficient, and more accurate than just voting by paper ballots. Although, one negative impact is that the rise of social media usage has caused misinformation to spread about candidates of the election.

It's an important to protect sensitive information online to prevent people from using that information with ill intentions. To prevent people from getting such information make sure the sites you go on are secure, set strong passwords, keep your account private, watch out for scams, and definitely do not post about things like where you live/work/ go to school. If you ever posted something you now realize is too personal just remember the internet is forever and you should be more mindful about what you post next time. To keep your info safe while also actively working and collaborating online with others you can easily just NOT share stuff that has nothing to do with what your working on. Especially if no one asked.

A current even that impacts me is the crisis of me deciding my future job. For a long while I wanted to be a computer developer but upon learning that computer science majors are pretty useless nowadays it has caused me to shy away from computer science. Now, I am looking into becoming an entreprenuer. Why is this relevant to the main topic which is originally how technology impacts a current event that impacts me/my community, you may ask? Well, just jump to the next paragraph so I can tell you.
Technology has helped me by allowing me to use online tools to help me go on this journey to find my dream career. I have used, google, school links, and apps like Indeed to find my dream job. I wouldn't have been able to use said sites without my phone or computer which is technology (in case you didn't know ðŸ˜¼). I'm not going to lie I have been straight stalling this whole time and hopefully my yap session was very intriguing and doesn't affect my grade.

Thanks to farmers, we regular people get to eat delicous fresh food that we buy from the grocery stores. Thanks to technology, farmers get to easily and efficiently grow said food. Things like precision agriculture use gps, sensors, and data analytics to help monitor and manage crops. It helps by allowing farmers to optimise yields, reduce waste, and enviromental impact.

From what I've heard, there has been new developements in VR technology that allows students to learn while in using said VR technology. I once saw a video of a science teacher using VR to take students on a field trip to a museum about animals or something. In the video, it showed what looked like the animals coming to life and moving as if they were actually there watching flying animals. Another cool thing I found out about was that VR has become more advanced by using technology that mimics real-world physcial sensations. This means if it's raining in the VR then you'll be able to feel it on your skin.

To me, brainrot means memes that people on social media push until it's so annoying that people begin to use it ironically. Some examples of that is things like the Ohio memes, Hawk Tuah, and phrases like "Ho is u cool?". In all honesty, I have a life outside of social media so I it doesn't affect me in a negative way. If anything, I find brainrot to be really funny. Never heard of slop, sounds European, but I've heard of lore and I love that word. When it comes to lore, I'd say mine is pretty but I can make good lore for characters. Moving on, if you're not a child or an immature person in general, it's very easy to engage with technology without being falling for brainrot.

I am absolutely looking forward to my winter break. For two whole weeks I don't have to do any school work and I can just rot in bed. I can eat good foods, sleep in, and right after my break ends it will be my birthday. During winter break, there's Chrismas, my birthday, and my baby brother's birthday. Fun fact, my dad's birthday is on Christmas. I'm not actually excited for Christmas but I am excited to be staying at home for two weeks straight.

Looking back I really enjoyed being able to be on my phone, eat snacks, and work on my project. I like this class a lot. I really just want to learn how to make a website and maybe make a game or app or something like that. I really like python and hope to master is so I can code games for fun.

I don't think Ai is going to take over EVERYTHING since there are some things only humans can do. An example is that only us humans can fix AI or create code from scratch. What I mean by that is the AI cannot just code things without being given directions to do so. AI doesn't think on it's own, it needs an algorithm or instructions to do something (at least from what I know). Even if it does take over some jobs, it'll create new jobs. Like, if they use AI to make janitor robots they have to have someone code the robot to make it clean. I highly doubt janitor AI will be introduced anytime soon but if it is introduced within my timeline of existence then I think humans need to have an intervention on their laziness. Plus, it would probably be more cost effective to have an AI robot janitor rather than a real human Janitor.

Well for one, I think this whole ban thing should be over and done with. The whole interview thing where that old guy kept asking dumb questions really speaks for our government quite a bit. I also think they have no legit reason to ban it, they only banned it because they speculated that the Chinese were stealing our data and last I don't think conjecture is a good basis to just ban something that everyone likes. It makes the American government seem idiotic, paranoid, and pretty rasicst which affects US citizens as a whole. In all honesty, to protect users data you just have to hope and pray their not stupid. Things like sharing credit card numbers (or worse social security numbers) can get people in lots of trouble when it comes to data. It would propably be a good idea to create warnings if this happens like: Warning! Data Security at Risk! Or something along those lines. The only lessons I can learn from this is that if your not a US made company their gonna accuse you of stealing data and ban you.

Some measures that could be taken to avoid accidents like that air crash collision is, for one, to teach people to rely less on technology. Of course it is still needed for the air craft but some things don't need to rely solely on technology. Another thing they can do is increase protection from Malware and viruses, keep it updated at all times, and conduct regular maintenance. Hire people who are dedicated to their jobs. Someone who would willingly check over and over to make sure the program isn't at risk of failure to secure human lives.

Last week I finally learned what 40 acres and a mule is. I didn't watch the halftime show but I did hear about the term on social media, which is crazy because this is probably something I could've been taught in my history class last year. Basically, 40 acres and a mule was a promise made to give land and resources to previously enslaved African Americans. It was intented to help them become for economically self-sufficent. Suprise, surprise, the next president after Abraham Lincoln reversed it, forcing African Americans to give up their land back to their former confederate owners and making the African Americans share croppers. What's worse is this has long time affected African Americans; even in modern day USA. Nowadays, 40 acres and a mule symbolizes broken promises and inequality to black Americans.

  Well, there already is a way technology bridges the language gap that adults have with teens using slang. It's called urban dictionary.I think it's pretty dumb to have a slang interpretator because we already have urban dictionary. However, if it ever became a big problem, which I doubt, then someone can just make an app with current teenage slang and add definitions and examples. 
  Also it would be stupid to make slang formal since it's already informal, considering the fact most slang is abbreviations. Slang is used among teenagers, usually with friends or people they're comfortable with, automatically making it informal. If someone were to misunderstand slang words like "HELP"-which is commonly used when someone is 'dying' of laughter-it could lead to adults thinking this person is in trouble. Luckily, only old people would be that dense so I think we're okay.

During my spring break the only technology I used was my phone, tv, and I guess riding in my grandma's car if that counts. On normal days, I would wake up and use my electrical toothbrush to brush my teeth. Then, I'd play on my phone for hours until heating up some food in my microwave. These are just a few ways I unknowingly interacted with technology.
My toothbrush made cleaning my teeth more efficient and satisfying, microwaving my food allowed me to heat up nutrients without too much trouble, and playing games on my phone kept me entertained. I do admit while I'm using said technology I'll sometimes wonder what kind of code was used to make it work.

I am NOT watching no basketball tournament so I don't even know how to answer this, but I'll try anyway for the grade. For the first question, there is literally no reason to use AI to predict a basketball tournament. I say this because I like to see the outcome of things and not have it be predicted and possibly be completely wrong. I mean, AI is pretty neat but using it for EVERYTHING makes humans as a whole seem lazy and even more reliant on technology. 
On to the second question, I believe social media and streaming platforms make spreading the word about things and events much easier. However, you have to be good at marketing for people to want to watch the event. Like for example, if a snack brand tried to market their snack to me using incorrect slang I might purposely go out of my way to talk trash about the snack just to spite them. Luckily, I don't have many friends to be able to do that so the snack brand is safe for now.

Mentally, emotionally, and physically tired and just drained from work, but we must persevere. The most stressful part of school is how much work they give with little time to do it knowing we have other classes of work to do. Honestly, I just watch tv, crash out, or take alone time to deal with stress. I guess I have to motviate myself with visions of the future to keep me from failing. My main goal is to pass with all A's and to keep me motivated I imagine the pride i'd feel being the best of the best. Honestly, my friend Aliyah because she's judgement free and is most likely to relate to the struggles.

I'm a little sad Ai is grading our papers since it's more entertaining imagining the faces of the people who have to grade the horrendous "essays" of some students. However, it does take less time and manpower to grade the thousands of essays from students all across the second largest state in the U.S.. The AI will probably be more strict and less biased than an actual human being, so it would offer valid critiscm. 
AI cites sources that provide the exact information students might need, whilst if a student tried to look up the information their own they might not be able to find what they need. However, in my opinion, I prefer having a real life person explain something to me. I enjoy it. I'd argue that Ai is more useful because it's one on one teaching the user. Meanwhile, a teacher has to teach a whole class of students with different types of learning styles. However, I'm a logical and fast learner so I prefer being taught by a person. Although, Ai is still very helpful.

Florida, the state always doing the most, has banned the use of phones and being on social media during school hours. It has valid reasons for doing so, but it also has valid critiscm that follows. I, for one, think it's stupid and that schools should just quit trying to ban phones already. 
For one, the U.S. is notorious for it's many school shootings. Not only that but Florida is filled with crazy people. You do the math. My mom likes to text me throughout the day to ask me stuff about things like groceries, tests, tutoring, or dance practice. Imagine a school shooter just decides to pop up out of nowhere and I don't even get to tell my mom goodbye. The cyberbullying part is a quick fix in all honesty. Kids just need to learn to speak up for themselves or others, so yeah. Plus, nowadays, no one is cyberbullying anyone.

Dear Ms Selwyn,
  Hi, I know this may seem random but I'm sending you this as an appreciation email. I'm not sure if you'll even see this, but if you do, sorry if this seems random. For context, I'm doing this as a journal grade and you're probably the only teacher who hasn't ever gotten on my nerves. One thing I appreciate about you is that you allow me to turn in my work late. I'm a huge procrastinator, I get distracted easily, and I have the memory of a goldfish. That's a deadly combo if you ask me. You have single handedly allowed me to maintain mostly all A's year round with your patience and kindess. 
  Thank you for all that you do.
  Sincerely, Shayla Martinez.

First of all, put me in a room with a gorilla and I'm coming out victorious. Second of all, we all know 100 modern day men are dumber than a box of rocks. Just kidding, but anyway. I honestly think the men would win. They may not have strenght on their side but they do have resilience and numbers. Plus, if they all attacked at once they could essentially tire out the gorilla and win. Therefore, I think 100 men would come out victorious.

This whole chromebook challenge is genuinely so stupid. It's just a way for students who are failing to hurt themselves or others for clout. It's dumb and it goes to show why those kids are 'F students'. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they got their computers taken away permanently, or better yet, ISS. I honestly don't know why people do this. Do they need attention at home? Perhaps, but that's not important. 
This trend isn't a good idea because it hurts students and makes the school have to spend extra money to buy new computers.By stuffing stuff into the charging port and stuff can cause an electrical fire. This is dangerous and can lead to people and students getting hurt. Guess who's gonna have to pay for it? The students parents or the school. Not only that, but the student involved vould be in serious trouble and we all know everyone hates ISS.

Am I ready for summer? Heck yeah! Summer is the only time of the year I get to sleep in and not worry about doing pointless work that more than likely won't contribute to my future career nor make me money. This summer, I plan to do driver's ED and get my permit, get a job, build a routine, make some money, and go swimming. I've already applied for a job (wish me luck). I hope my summer isn't all just sitting around the house and doing absolutely nothing. Because that would suck and I would be sad.
