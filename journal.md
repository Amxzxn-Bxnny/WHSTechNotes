Python for me is kinda hard but only because I'm used to coding with blocks and unfortunately for me in my Fundamentals of Computer Science Class the kids weren't very smart and constantly dragged me down. Also my teacher didn't explain things well. Anyway, Python isn't too bad but I need to be more resourceful when it comes to my time because I'm a bit behind. Today, I'm definitly going to be faster and more vigilant with my time to take the necessary amount to take notes and actions in my Python coding journey.

I'd say my experience learning python hasn't been so bad. It's true that it's kinda like learning another language but at least the words are still in a language that I know. I've been a bit slow on my journey since my school changed my account for whatever reason but it's fine because I'm back on track. Writing notes makes the process slower but it helps me learn better so oh well. I can't wait to learn other coding languages and basically just learn how to code better in general, I'm over coding these drones.

Easy and simple, honestly I got it first try and I'm not sure how others didn't. Though I don't mean to be condescending, everyone moves at their own pace I guess. It was easier for me to just read the instructions on the Github stuff that you gave me the link to.

Following instructions exactly as they're told in coding are important because it'll get you where you need to be with little to no problems. If you keep your code nice and precise your code should come out like how you planned it to come out. If you miss a step or make a mistake with coding you may get an error and your code will malfunction or just simply not work. If you maintian good habits of paying attention to detail it'll be beneficial to you by allowing you to notice mistakes or instructions others might've missed.

Things like phones, tvs, and even a washing machine were created thanks to computer science. I use my phone everyday to contact my friends and family, my tv for entertainment purposes, and my washing machine quickly and efficiently cleans my clothes. Without computer science, I would lose tabs on my friends, probably play outside in the dirt and mud like a medieval child, and wash my clothes by hand. That would be hell on Earth. Not only that but I'd probably have to ride a bike or walk to school since modern day cars with gps and sterio and whatnot were also made by the hands of computer science.

For this assignment I researched a video game developer. Video game developers mostly just design/make video games for consoles, computers, and mobile. The skills required to be a video game developer are storytelling ability, creativity, game mechanics, programming skills, and etc. Education required is a bachelor's at minimum. By being a game developer you should expect to grow more creatively and become better at coding. I'm not intersted in being a video game developer myself but it does seem fun.

Even if you don't have a job that includes the need to code, coding is still an important thing to know. Coding is capable of giving you subperb problem solving skill by making you break down the steps to complex problems and simpifying it into something easier to understand. If you're in a field like education, finance, and healthcare then knowing how to code might help you with things like problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking skills. Knowing code can also help enhance creativity and collaboration by allowing you to think outside the box and giving to the courage and humility to ask for help and work with others.

AI is becoming a more prominent and controversial topic in today's society so I'm here to give the benefits and risks of AI. One benefit of AI is it reduces human errors by doing things with more efficiency and with more accuracy. AI saves time and can aid us people digitally by giving us answers to questions we may have. It makes unbiased decisions which can really be helpful when certain people can't seperate facts and opinions.
AI can be helpful but it also poses risks as well. Although it can't take over the world, it can promote human laziness by causing humans to heavily rely on it over time. AI can also replace humans for jobs that AI can perform "better" and more efficiently. AI also lacks emotional intelligence so there's that too. No sure why, but humans become paranoid over things that don't have feelings too which is why it's seen as a drawback.
